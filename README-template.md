## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

 Screenshot of my final result:
 
![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

Started pretty quickly and much more effective than the QR Code challenge as I already had a base thanks to that challenge. Managed to get the structure, the css, fonts, etc... Pretty much together in just some minutes.

Next, I need to figure out how to make everything fit correctly into place, as now there are 2 div class one inside the other and pretty much everything needs a bit of css to make it look like the preview, but its getting there.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I can say that Im enjoying this one more as I noticed now I know how to do it properly and I can start doing it rather than guess how to do it.

Its true that having two div classes at first was a bit hard to manage but 5 minutes later had it figured out as I didnt know I had to put one inside the other, but pretty cool.

```html
<div class="card">
  <img src="./assets/images/illustration-article.svg" alt="illustration-article">
  <div class="content">
    <h2>Learning</h2>
